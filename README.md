What is it?
-------------------------

I created cpp_logic_simulation to explore C++ language features and development methodologies that I do not usually use in my C++ work - due to the resource-constrained nature of the typical target platforms (eg, 512 ~ 2K bytes RAM) - and to scratch a personal itch, having felt inspired by the idea of creating some sort of logic simulator for a number of years.

cpp_logic_simulation is a framework for constructing simulations of digital [logic circuits](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-logic/all). The logic circuits comprise instances of a *Component* class, sub-classed into *Gate* and *Device* classes. *Gates* are n-input representations of the [logical operators](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-logic/all#combinational-logic) NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR. Arbitrary numbers of *Gates* can be interconnected within *Devices*. These *Devices* can then interconnected nested-within further *Devices*, ad-nauseum, and in this way arbitrarily complex logic circuits can be assembled from the primary *Gate* building blocks. [See](./sim_src/devices/devices.cpp) `./sim_src/devices/devices.cpp` for examples.

A further sub-class of the *Device* class is the *Simulation* class, which lies at the top-level and contains the *Device* or *Devices* that comprise the logic circuit. The *Simulation* can also contain members of two additional utility classes, *Clocks* to drive the contained logic circuit, and *Probes*, which can sample and display the logical state of any inputs or outputs of *Gates* or *Devices* within the circuit. The state of the logic circuit is recalculated automatically in response to any state changes at it's inputs. However, sampling and displaying state using *Probes* can only occur while the simulation is 'running', with the circuit driven via one or more *Clocks*.

To do anything more interesting than view *Probe* output tables of changing logic levels within the circuit, a way to 'break the fourth wall' and interface with system resources 'outside' of the simulation is required. This is provided by a final *Device* sub-class, the *MagicDevice*. In addition to the usual *Device* functionality, *MagicDevices* contain special custom code (the *MagicEngine*) to interact with system resources outside of the simulation, and interfaces that hook into the simulated operation of the logic-circuit, and vice-versa. This allows us to create *MagicDevices* that, for example, behave as a RAM IC by accessing data contained in an array, a ROM IC by accessing data contained in a text file, or even a UART-like IC communicating with a remote text terminal! See `./sim_src/magic_devices/simple_ram.cpp`, `simple_rom.cpp` and `simple_terminal.cpp` for examples.

Basic example.
-------------------------

Let's dive-in and make something.

[Sequential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_logic) digital logic circuits need a way to store state. To this they typically make use of [flip-flops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)), a bi-stable logic circuit that can 'latch' in one of two states, of which there are a number of types.

The simplest flip-flop type is the [SR latch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR_AND-OR_latch). An SR latch can be made in a number of ways, but the pedagologically simplest version comprises one AND gate, one OR gate, and an inverter (NOT 'gate'). Let's simulate one.

```cpp
// sr_latch_demo.cpp

#include "c_core.h"			// Core simulator functionality

int main () {
	bool verbose_flag = false;                     // Set = true to see 'verbose output' on the console.
	Simulation sim("sr_latch", verbose_flag);
	
	bool monitor_flag = true;                      // monitor_flag = true to print changes at out pins on the console.
	sim.AddGate("or_0", "or", {"input_0", "input_1"}, monitor_flag);
	sim.AddGate("and_0", "and", {"input_0", "input_1"}, monitor_flag);
	sim.AddGate("not_0", "not", monitor_flag);     // NOT gate only has one in pin "input" by default.
	
	sim.ChildConnect("or_0", {"and_0", "input_0"});
	sim.ChildConnect("not_0", {"and_0", "input_1"});
	sim.ChildConnect("and_0", {"or_0", "input_0"});

	sim.Connect("false", "or_0", "input_1");       // Cannot have un-driven in pins so we connect Simulation's
	sim.Connect("false", "not_0");                 // utility pin "false" to both.
	
	sim.Stabilise();                               // Once we have assembled circuit call Stabilise().
	
	// or_0:input_1 is 'S', not_0:input is 'R', and_0:output is 'Output'
	
	// 'S' (set).
	sim.ChildSet("or_0", "input_1", true);
	sim.ChildSet("or_0", "input_1", false);
	
	// 'R' (reset).
	sim.ChildSet("not_0", "input", true);
	sim.ChildSet("not_0", "input", false);
	
	// 'S' (set).
	sim.ChildSet("or_0", "input_1", true);
	sim.ChildSet("or_0", "input_1", false);
	
	// 'R' (reset).
	sim.ChildSet("not_0", "input", true);
	sim.ChildSet("not_0", "input", false);
	
	return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

Great! We can see the output responding to the changing input stimulus as we should expect for an SR latch.

Encapsulating our circuit in a *Device*.
-------------------------

We can take our circuit and encapsulate it in a *Device*. We can then easily instantiate multiple copies of it in a single simulation, or re-use it elsewhere.

First of all we need to create a class definition for our device, inheriting from the core *Device* class. We are obliged to define a constructor and a member function Device::Build() within which we will describe how to assemble our new device.

```cpp
// sr_latch.h

#include "c_core.h"			// Core simulator functionality

class SR_Latch : public Device {
	public:
		SR_Latch(Device* parent_device_pointer, std::string name, bool monitor_on = false,
		         std::vector<state_descriptor> input_default_states = {});
		void Build(void);
};
```

Next we create the class implementation for our device. The Base *Device* class constructor is called first, among other things will create the device in pins ("S" & "R") and out pin ("Out"). Next our device constructor calls Build() which will create the SR latch circuit more-or-less as in the previous example.

```cpp
// sr_latch.cpp

#include "c_core.h"			// Core simulator functionality

SR_Latch::SR_Latch(Device* parent_device_pointer, std::string name, bool monitor_on, std::vector<state_descriptor> input_default_states) 
 : Device(parent_device_pointer, name, "sr_latch", {"S", "R"}, {"Out"}, monitor_on, input_default_states) {
	// Following base class constructor (Device), we call the below overridden Build() method to populate the
	// specific device, then we call the base Stabilise() method to configure initial internal device component state.
	Build();
	Stabilise();
}

void SR_Latch::Build() {
	AddGate("or_0", "or", {"input_0", "input_1"}, false);   // monitor_on flag can be omitted,
	AddGate("and_0", "and", {"input_0", "input_1"});        // defaults to false.
	AddGate("not_0", "not");
	
	ChildConnect("or_0", {"and_0", "input_0"});
	ChildConnect("not_0", {"and_0", "input_1"});
	ChildConnect("and_0", {"or_0", "input_0"});

	Connect("S", "or_0", "input_1");                        // device's Connect() member function used
	Connect("R", "not_0");                                  // to connect parent in pin to child in pin.
	ChildConnect("and_0", {"parent", "Out"});               // ChildConnect() member function used to connect
	                                                        // child out pin to parent out pin.
}
```

We use our newly defined *Device* in much the same way as in the previous example.

```cpp
// sr_latch_demo_2.cpp

#include "c_core.h"           // Core simulator functionality
#include "sr_latch.h"         // Our new SR_latch device.

int main () {
	bool verbose = false;
	bool monitor_on = true;
	
	Simulation sim("test_sim", verbose);
	
	sim.AddComponent(new SR_Latch(&sim, "test_latch", monitor_on, {{"S", false}, {"R", false}}));
	
	sim.Stabilise();
}
```

Running the demos:
-------------------------

cpp_logic_simulation currently requires POSIX support for console io, and as-such cannot be compiled and run natively on Windows. It is possible to compile and run cpp_logic_simulation [on Windows](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/andrey.mokhov/EEE1008/first-c-program.html) using [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), 'a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a GNU/Linux distribution on Windows', but that is outside the scope of this README. 

An elementary makefile is provided for the demos, so to compile a particular demo on GNU/Linux navigate to the root project directory on the command line and enter `make demo_name`, where `demo_name` is the name of one of the demo .cpp files with the .cpp file extension omitted.

For example, to compile and run the jk flip-flop demo ([jk_ff_demo.cpp](jk_ff_demo.cpp)), enter:

```
user@home:~/cpp_logic_simulation$ make jk_ff_demo
user@home:~/cpp_logic_simulation$ ./jk_ff_demo
```

If you would like to experiment with creating new *Devices* using the framework, when compiling make sure to include the `-pthread` compiler flag to add multi-threading support via the pthreads library.
